# README

This API will allow the user to see which animals are available for adoption in our local animal shelter. Users will be able to plug in directly to our api via front end application or service like Postman. The user will be able to: see all of the information for each animal, add new a animal to the shelter, edit an animal's information, and delete an animal once it is adopted. We hope this API will help more animals find loving homes!
